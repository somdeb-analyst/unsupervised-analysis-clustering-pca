# 🔍 Unsupervised Learning: Clustering & PCA on Real-World Datasets

This project applies **clustering** and **principal component analysis (PCA)** on two real-world datasets – one related to digital advertising and the other to census and health data. It uncovers hidden patterns, segments users, and visualizes high-dimensional data in simplified form.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Apply unsupervised learning to identify natural groupings in the data
- Use PCA to reduce dimensionality and visualize data structure
- Interpret clusters to extract actionable insights
- Understand feature influence on clustering behavior

---

## 🗃️ Datasets Used

### 📦 Dataset 1: Ad Click Behavior
- User interaction metrics with digital ads
- Features: Click rate, time spent, bounce rate, impressions, conversions, etc.

### 🏥 Dataset 2: Census & Health Survey
- Socio-economic and demographic data
- Features: Age, education, number of children, income level, employment type, etc.

---

## ✅ Key Analysis Performed

- Data cleaning and normalization
- Feature scaling and dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Applied KMeans clustering and determined optimal K using elbow & silhouette methods
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots and principal components
- Interpreted clusters based on centroid profiles and PCA loadings

---

## 📊 Visual Insights

- 2D PCA scatter plots with clusters colored distinctly
- Bar plots comparing feature means across clusters
- Scree plots and explained variance from PCA
- Silhouette scores and elbow curves for optimal K selection

## 💡 Key Findings

- Distinct user groups emerged in ad dataset: high-engagement, bounce-prone, and converters
- PCA reduced feature space while preserving structure for clustering
- In census data, clusters showed variation by education, family size, and occupation
- PCA loadings revealed which attributes influenced cluster separation the most
