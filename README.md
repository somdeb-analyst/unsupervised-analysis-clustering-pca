# 📊 Clustering and PCA Project – Unsupervised Learning on Advertising & Census Data

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques—**KMeans Clustering**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**—to advertising and census datasets. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns, reduce dimensionality, and derive insights from large datasets without labeled outputs.

## 📁 Project Overview

### 🧩 Part 1: Clustering – Advertisement Dataset
**Objective**: Segment different advertisements based on audience reactions and ad characteristics.

**Key Tasks**:
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Dendrogram analysis for optimal clusters
- KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering
- Cluster interpretation using visualizations

### 🧮 Part 2: PCA – Census Dataset
**Objective**: Reduce dimensionality and identify key contributing variables in high-dimensional census data.

**Key Tasks**:
- Normalization of data
- PCA fitting and explained variance analysis
- Scree plot and cumulative variance chart
- Bi-plot and interpretation of top principal components
